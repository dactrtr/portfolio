    .who-is
      p.desc.
        Hi, I'm #[strong Sebastián Zúñiga], #[a(href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dactrtr/") UI designer] and #[a(href="https://www.instagram.com/dactrtr.svg/") Illustrator], always looking for the new "tech kid on the block", researching to improve my work, or developing (I also like to#[a(href="https://github.com/dactrtr") code]) new skills. I'm the serious looking funny guy at every place and the designer that is in the middle of the developers talking like one more of the pack.
      p.desc.
        #[strong Hey!] wait, all that knowledge research is #[strong useless if isn't shared], that's why with one of my #[a(href="http://www.arielcerda.com/") friends] we run a small group of #[a(href="https://medium.com/sketchchile") Sketch]
          where we share tutorials and stuff so cool that sometimes seems to be #[strong frozen].
      p.desc Actually based in #[a(href="https://footprints.zen.ly/dactrtr") somewhere], working remotely for #[a(href="http://www.elun.cl") Elun].
      p.desc Previously at #[a(href="https://www.mckinsey.com/") Mckinsey Chile] and #[a(href="https://dena.com/intl/") DeNA Chile]

                    Created a scalable and highly customizable foundation in Sketch, with an atomic design approach setting the foundations for a design system, with a control version in Abstract, Translated the designs into code using VUE, SASS, and HTML. This was my first time using VUE

                    Deeper my knowledge in front end, learn the basis of VUE, and create more than a "dribbbleish" design, a robust foundation for a design system, by myself.
